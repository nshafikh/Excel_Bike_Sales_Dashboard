## Project Objective
- Using survey data of participants who entered bike shops globally, our goal is to gain insights regarding prospective customers and their likelihood to go through with purchasing a bike.

## Questions (KPIs)
- How does income/house ownership affect likelihood to go through with purchase?
- Does work commute time influence bike purchase rate?
- Which age bracket purchases bikes at the highest rate?
- Are married individuals more or less likely to purchase a bike?
- Are people in more sedentary occupations more likely to make the purchase?
- Does region change the answers to any of the above questions?

## Process
- Clean and standardize the data, prioritizing rows that are crucial for answering KPIs
- Create a pivot table showing the relationships that gender (accounting for income), age, and work commute distance have with bike purchases
- Create visualizations that show the most compelling insights
- Add filters to see how these purchasing trends slightly change or completely flip for different demographics (homeownership, marital status, region, occupation)

## Project Insight
- In all cases except for females in Europe, the average income of customers who purchased a bike was than those who walked out empty-handed
- Work commute time affects purchases differently in each region:
    - Europe: Majority of people who purchase or even consider purchasing a bike are within 1 mile of their work
    - North America: Customers are more likely to make a purchase if they are within 2 and 5 miles of their work
    - Pacific: High number of purchases regardless of distance to work
- Majority of the customers fall within the 35-49 age bracket
- All other age brackets are more likely to not complete the purchase 
- Homeowners complete bike purchases at similar rates to those who are renting, but homeowners are more likely to enter the store
- Married people are less likely to enter the store but are far more likely to complete the purchase as a global trend
- Unlike most other demographics, married women in North America with lower incomes are more likely to purchase bikes
- Clerical workers follow through with purchases at the lowest rate
