# Interactive Dashboards Exhibit

Three interactive data dashboards (Excel, Power BI, Tableau) using three different datasets that can pull various insights through different permutations of filter selections and accompanying visuals.

## Project Objective
- Using Airbnb listing data in Seattle, gather insights to help guide real estate investments (which houses should we purchase with intent to rent)

## Questions
- How does the number of bedrooms affect the average price of an Airbnb rental?
- Which zipcodes within Seattle are most lucrative?
- What is the bedroom demand for renters in Seattle?
- Which part of the year was most popular for Airbnb rentals in Seattle?

## Process
- Join the listings data with the calendar data to see which listings were booked by date
- Create a visualization on each sheet to answer each of the above questions
- Assemble these visualizations in the dashboard

## Project Insight
- Less people are renting Seattle Airbnbs in January and February
- The rest of the year sees a consistent revenue, with a slight increase around the holidays
- Rental prices increase at decreasing rates based on their number of bedrooms, but then increases dramatically once we get to five bedrooms
- The demand and revenue for one bedroom units exceed other listings by far, with rapid decline in listings and revenue for each bedroom added
- Pretty even balance of lucrative and budget areas, but 98199 is by far the most expensive

## Project Objective
- Using survey data of participants who entered bike shops globally, our goal is to gain insights regarding prospective customers and their likelihood to go through with purchasing a bike.

## Questions
- How does income/house ownership affect likelihood to go through with purchase?
- Does work commute time influence bike purchase rate?
- Which age bracket purchases bikes at the highest rate?
- Are married individuals more or less likely to purchase a bike?
- Are people in more sedentary occupations more likely to make the purchase?
- Does region change the answers to any of the above questions?

## Process
- Clean and standardize the data, prioritizing rows that are crucial for answering KPIs
- Create a pivot table showing the relationships that gender (accounting for income), age, and work commute distance have with bike purchases
- Create visualizations that show the most compelling insights
- Add filters to see how these purchasing trends slightly change or completely flip for different demographics (homeownership, marital status, region, occupation)

## Project Insight
- In all cases except for females in Europe, the average income of customers who purchased a bike was than those who walked out empty-handed
- Work commute time affects purchases differently in each region:
    - Europe: Majority of people who purchase or even consider purchasing a bike are within 1 mile of their work
    - North America: Customers are more likely to make a purchase if they are within 2 and 5 miles of their work
    - Pacific: High number of purchases regardless of distance to work
- Majority of the customers fall within the 35-49 age bracket
- All other age brackets are more likely to not complete the purchase 
- Homeowners complete bike purchases at similar rates to those who are renting, but homeowners are more likely to enter the store
- Married people are less likely to enter the store but are far more likely to complete the purchase as a global trend
- Unlike most other demographics, married women in North America with lower incomes are more likely to purchase bikes
- Clerical workers follow through with purchases at the lowest rate

## How to access: Downloadable Power BI file included in the repository

## Project Objective
- Using survey data gathered from data professionals, gain more insights regarding specific roles, age, preferences, satisfaction, and difficulty to get into their data career.

## Questions
- What is the average age of the survey participant?
- Where are these participants living/working in data fields?
- What are their current job titles?
- How does job title and location influence job satisfaction?
- What programming languages are preferred, and under which circumstances?
- Are salary and work/life balance satisfaction correlated?

## Process
- Gather questions that can be answered by the data
- Clean the dataset (simplify column names, standardize the data to ensure consistency, represent the data in a way that can be visualized in a dashboard)
- Create a dashboard, starting from a macro perspective and creating visuals that answer these questions on behalf of all data professionals
- Go down to a more granular level and include visuals/filters that derive insights from different countries, job roles 

## Project Insight
- US data professionals seem to be most satisfied with their work/life balance and salary, and Indian data professionals are least satisfied (NOTE: US participants are almost 4 years older, not as early into their careers)
- Data scientists get paid noticeably more compared to other fields in US and India, but that gap decreases or actually flips when looking at UK and Canada
- Most data professionals found entering a data field to be moderate in difficulty (neither too easy nor too difficult)
- Data scientists and architects were typically satisfied with their salaries, whereas participants in other roles were more dissatisfied than satisfied
- Data architects appear to be most dissatisfied with their work life balance
